📊 School Grades Average Calculator

A simple school grades average calculator that demonstrates how a small idea can evolve into a more robust and professional software solution.

This project showcases the progressive improvement of the same core concept, applying different programming techniques and software design principles at each stage.

🚀 Project Evolution

🔹 Version 1 — Basic Logic
A straightforward calculator built using if and else statements, with user input handled directly via the console.
The goal here is to understand basic control flow and input handling.

🔹 Version 2 — Functions
The calculator logic is encapsulated inside a function, improving code organization, readability, and reusability.

🔹 Version 3 — Data Handling
In addition to using functions, this version accepts a student identifier as an argument and stores the results, allowing the data to be exported to an Excel file 📁📈.

🔹 Version 4 — Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
The project is refactored using OOP principles, resulting in cleaner, more maintainable, and more professional code.

🔹 Version 5 — GUI & Distribution
OOP concepts are combined with a graphical user interface 🖥️, making the application more user-friendly and enabling distribution as a standalone executable file.

🔹 Version 6 — MVC Architecture Refactor
The project is fully refactored to follow the Model–View–Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
Business logic is isolated in the Model, user interaction and interface are handled by the View, and application flow is managed by the Controller.
This refactor significantly improves code organization, scalability, testability, and aligns the project with real-world software engineering practices.

✨ This repository demonstrates how applying architectural patterns and best practices over time can dramatically improve code quality and transform a simple calculator into a well-structured software project.
