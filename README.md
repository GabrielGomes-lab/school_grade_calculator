📊 School Grades Average Calculator

A simple school grades average calculator that demonstrates how a small idea can evolve into a more robust and professional software solution.

This project showcases the progressive improvement of the same core concept, applying different programming techniques and design principles at each stage.

🚀 Project Evolution

🔹 Version 1 — Basic Logic
A straightforward calculator built using if and else statements, with user input handled directly via the console.
The goal here is to understand basic control flow and input handling.

🔹 Version 2 — Functions
The calculator logic is encapsulated inside a function, improving code organization, readability, and reusability.

🔹 Version 3 — Data Handling
In addition to using functions, this version accepts a student identifier as an argument and stores the results, allowing the data to be exported to an Excel file 📁📈.

🔹 Version 4 — Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
The project is refactored using OOP principles, resulting in cleaner, more maintainable, and more professional code.

🔹 Version 5 — GUI & Distribution
The final version applies OOP concepts alongside a graphical user interface 🖥️, making the application more user-friendly and enabling distribution as an executable file.

✨ This repository highlights how applying software engineering best practices over time can significantly improve code quality, scalability, and usability — even for a simple calculator.
